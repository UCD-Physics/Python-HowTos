        "When taking measurements, a way to increase accuracy can be to use myADC.smaplevoltages(). This function allows multiple measurements to be taken at a certain frequency. For example 'data = myADC.smaplevoltages(2000, 4000)' will create an array called data with 2000 samples at a rate of 4000 samples per second (i.e. will take 0.5 seconds to take the data). This is very useful as it is then possible to use the mean of this array as your data point and the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of samples as your error. This greatly increases the accuracy of your experiment and can lead to better results. Once again, ensure to create empty lists before the loop in order to store the information correctly.\n"
