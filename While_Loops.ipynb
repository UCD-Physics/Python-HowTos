    "# How to write 'While' loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are very helpful for iterating a calculation and are used a lot when interfacing in order to collect data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python there are two main type of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "`for` loops are used for looping over iterables (e.g. values in a list) and `while` loops are used to loop until some condition is met. Please see a separate how-to notebook for `for` loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics covered in this notebook:\n",
    " * Basics of `while` loops\n",
    " * skipping the rest of the current loop with continue\n",
    " * exiting the for loop with break"

    "## `While` loops\n",
    "\n",
    "`while` loops repeatedly execute while some condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic `while` loop syntax is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    execute_statements1\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    execute_statements2\n",
    "```\n",
    "where\n",
    " * `condition` is bool and the loop gets executed as long as it is true \n",
    " * `execute_statements` are blocks of statements defined by indentation.\n",
    " * the `else` clause is optional and rarely used - it only gets executed if the main loop terminates without a break statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each iteration of the while loop, it returns and checks the condition agin, and if still true, it executes the loop again. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is best illustrated through examples:"
